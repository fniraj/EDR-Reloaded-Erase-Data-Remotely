This repository presents a project titled "EDR Reloaded: Erase Data Remotely," which explores the importance of remote data erasure (EDR) in healthcare environments. The project highlights the critical need for secure data deletion when devices are lost, stolen, or compromised, especially given the sensitivity of patient information. It explains how failure to implement effective EDR can lead to serious consequences, including legal penalties, reputational damage, and disruption of medical services. The presentation outlines key security and privacy concerns, such as unauthorized access, malware threats, and system vulnerabilities, and discusses the operational challenges of deploying EDR solutions across healthcare systems. To address these issues, the project proposes feasible strategies like multifactor authentication, endpoint detection, regular data backups, and staff training. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that healthcare organizations can protect patient data, maintain compliance, and respond swiftly to potential breaches through robust and reliable EDR practices.
